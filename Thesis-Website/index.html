     <h1>Abstract</h1>
     <p>Now more than ever, people interested in quantifying life experiences have access to an unprecedented deluge of information about their own personal health, travel and communication patterns. Lifelogging projects in the connected age analyze and visualize these rich trails of data that are a byproduct of life online.</p> 
     <p>Unlike most lifelong projects, however, this installation interprets metadata extracted from a physical, non-digital artifact. 65401 is an interactive visualization of a small town in the Ozark mountains generated from the personal datebook my grandmother used when she worked as a real estate agent in the 1980s. Viewers use a tangible interface to generate a map of the town based off addresses, phone numbers and locations mentioned in this journal.</p> 
     <p>The goal of this installation is to map this geographic metadata in a public gallery context without revealing any of the diary’s original contents. The project explores data visualization theory, crowdsourced human intelligence, the limits of computer vision, and the interaction design of tangible interfaces.</p>

    <h4>Data Entry Methods</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Extracting the data to be visualized for my project was a time consuming endeavor. During this phase of the project, I discovered that optical character recognition software doesn't work with handwritten letters. Although I have access to journals from 1988, 1989 and 1990, I  found that I would only have enough time to encode and visualize one of these years. My challenge was to encode 300 JPG scanned images of handwritten notes with scribbles, doodles and coffee stains into something that can be parsed by a computer. I turned to Amazon Mechanical Turk to try to minimize the hours I would spend hand copying her notes into a XML document. I funded my AMT account with $10 and created 43 Human Intelligence Tasks. I created an HTML template that would show the image I needed transcoded on the left side of the screen and fields to input text dates and entry values. Only 5 of 43 were submitted, however, so I had to try another strategy to finish the project. </p>

    <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="img/visualization1.png">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Once the information was organized in a digital file, I was able to explore several data visualization strategies. Before I knew I wanted to focus on geographic information, I first created a test visualization that shows word count per entry in my grandmother's diary from January 1986. Each column represents one entry and each dot in that row represents a word.</p>
        <p>I went about making this visualization to figure out how I should structure my data within a JSON file so it can be parsed and visualized procedurally. Since the project involves so much hand transcribing of information, I needed to make sure that I wanted to use the D3.js library to do the heavy lifting for me in generating visualizations.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Prototype 2</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="img/visualization2.png">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>The visualization above looked at the frequency of times my grandmother mentioned a location in her journal, but it didn't give any sense of what that location looked like. For my second prototype, I wanted to viscerally connect the audience to the real locations my grandmother mentioned in her diary. For each address or street mentioned, I entered the location into Google Maps street view, zoomed out as far as I could and took a screenshot. After compiling all of these images, I used Adobe Photoshop's Batch Processing function to crop out all interface elements, resize the image to a manageable size and apply a black and white filter.</p>

        <p>Next, I created a processing sketch that lets viewers interact with a timeline from January 1 - March 31, 1988. If my grandmother visited a location on the selected date, an image from Google Maps street view is shown. If she visited multiple locations, photos of each location are layered in the same window.</p>

    <h4>Prototype 3</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="img/visualization3.png">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>A third prototype during the exploration period of this project involved designing a system that compared the geographic metadata of individual entries to the textual information contained within each entry. To accomplish this, I created a new processing sketch with two modes. After a user selects an entry date, they can toggle between the non-redacted version of the date in question or the version redacted to just geographic information.</p>
        <p>This prototype showed that many of the entries from my grandmother's diary do not reference specific locations. This discovery informed my decision to visualize location data in weeks and months, not days.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Prototype 4</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <iframe width='100%' height='500px' frameBorder='0' src='https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/mcarlile.l84h07kj/attribution,geocoder,share.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWNhcmxpbGUiLCJhIjoiOGdHNmxVMCJ9.7S_5i-9rrcECzYYGVddZyQ'></iframe>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>As I was working on the third prototype, I noticed that my grandmother’s entries often contained 10 digit sequences of numbers. After looking a few of them up, I uncovered that many of these were long distance telephone numbers to area codes outside of the state of Missouri. After getting a CSV with each date and phone number, I used Whitepages' Pro Graph API to map the phone numbers to specific addresses if possible and to zip codes if necessary. In the MapBox visualization, lines with lower opacity represent calls made only one time, while lines with higher opacity represent calls made multiple times.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Prototype 5</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <iframe width='100%' height='500px' frameBorder='0' src='https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/mcarlile.lhm94596/attribution,geocoder,share.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWNhcmxpbGUiLCJhIjoiOGdHNmxVMCJ9.7S_5i-9rrcECzYYGVddZyQ'></iframe>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>The final section of the project I worked on was organizing all addresses mentioned in the 1988 datebook into a comprehensive geoJSON file. Each location can now be given an infinite number of specific attributes, such as week or month visited, associated clients or styling information.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Final Visualization</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <img src="img/segmentedaddresses.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p>I finally settled on an 8x8 grid visualization to map the locations that my grandmother mentioned in her journal. Presenting the information with such low fidelity represents the inexact nature of the handwritten data set and data extraction process. </p>

        <p>I've included an example of this process above. For each week, I plotted all points from the dataset into a Mapbox project, broke the map into 64 equally-sized portions and encoded each section with a color in accordance to the frequency of locations mentioned that week.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Interface Blueprint</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12">
       <p>The final part of the project involves building the physical installation and coding the interactive interface. To reflect the fact that the information being visualized was originally stored in a physical artifact, I wanted my interface to be uniquely tactile. Viewers will navigate throughout time by twisting a physical control knob. The number of the current week is displayed above the LED matrix using a 7-segment display board.</p>
