                            <p>Every day, we are surrounded by narratives that people tell about themselves on social networking sites. Information about our lives which was once private is now shared publically. We share politcal and religious opinions on Twitter, photographs of intimate moments on services such as Instagram and Facebook. At the same time, more and more parts of our lives that used to be impossible to record are now being documented. Health and fitness information can be quantified and shared with the world through activity trackers and software. We record what beers we drink, who we drink them with and how we felt when we drank them. By activiely selecting what we share and what we chose to hide, we are unconsciously curating a socially acceptable "highlight reel" that poorly reflects our daily lives.</p>

                            <p>Journals and diaries, on the other hand, are often the truest depictions of our own experience. Because the intended audience for a diary is usually just the person who wrote it, they are intensely personal. In many ways, our journals are extensions of ourselves: they contain our goals and aspirations in addition to the stories about how we inevitably do or do not achieve them. We trust our diaries; because they are so private, we can freely use them to record the mundane and the painful parts of life that most people wouldn't feel comfortable sharing in public.</p> 

                            <p>This installation project seeks to visualize metadata taken from a personal journal and display that information in a public gallery context.The goal of the design is to develop a tangible interface that allows viewers to explore the life of my grandmohter, Barbara Holman. I hope to be able to design a system that gives viewers a small glimpse into the autobiographical story about her life in rural Missouri while protecting her private thoughts.</p>

                            <p>There are still significant challenges with extracting metadata from a handwritten journal. This project hopes to create the richest possible dataset using tools such as computer vision, natural language processing and sentiment analysis. </p>

                        <p>This project explores the invisible terrain of WiFi networks in urban spaces by light painting signal strength in long-exposure photographs. A four-metre tall measuring rod with 80 points of light reveals cross-sections through WiFi networks using a photographic technique called light-painting.</p>

An arched wall of hundreds of small screens display ever-changing text in a cool glowing blue. Electronically-generated voices in both a pitched-monotone and natural-inflection sing out the text from every corner of the room singly, overlapping, or in strange harmonies.</p>

                    <p>A visualization that compares word count per entry in my grandmother's diary from January 1986 and my personal journal entries from January 2014. Each row represents one entry and each dot in that row represents a word. Not much can be discerned from the comparison other than the fact that I'm a blabbermouth when compared to my grandmohter.</p>
                    <iframe src="visualization-mac.html" height="325px" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>
                    <p>I went about making this visualization to figure out how I should structure my data within a JSON file so it can be parsed and visualized proedurally. Since the project involves so much hand coding of information, I needed to make sure that I understood the fundamentals of D3.JS so it can do the heavy lifting for me. Since I'm still in the process of designing a visualization tool for my thesis, I consider this a major milestone.</p>
